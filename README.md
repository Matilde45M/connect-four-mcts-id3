# Connect Four AI – MCTS and Decision Trees

This project implements an AI system capable of playing Connect Four using adversarial search strategies and decision trees.

The work combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with the UCT strategy and a Decision Tree classifier implemented using the ID3 algorithm.

## Project Overview

The project consists of two main components:

### 1. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
- Implementation of MCTS using Upper Confidence Bound for Trees (UCT)
- Exploration of different simulation strategies
- AI capable of playing against a human or another AI agent

### 2. Decision Trees (ID3)
- Implementation of ID3 from scratch (no scikit-learn)
- Discretization of numerical features
- Training on:
  - Iris dataset
  - Connect Four state-move dataset generated using MCTS

## Key Concepts
- Adversarial search
- Monte Carlo simulations
- Upper Confidence Bound (UCT)
- Decision tree learning
- Game state evaluation
- Dataset generation from gameplay

## Technologies
- Python
- Artificial Intelligence algorithms
- Tree-based learning methods

## Repository Content
- Jupyter Notebook with full implementation
- Project description

## Notes
This project was developed for the Artificial Intelligence course.
No high-level ML libraries were used for the implementation of ID3.
